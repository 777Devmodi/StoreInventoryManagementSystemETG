# StoreInventoryManagementSystemETG
Its A basic Python Store Inventory Management System Where a person can buy something
Starting with record insertion and then its stored in json format with file commands 
And then actuall Billing process starts where first the keys of a dictionary is converted into the list and then with the help of that list and using the for loops and accessing of element we allow the user to buy the product and printing is details along with time 
and at the end the update quantity is again stored back in json format in that file  
Along with the Sales record which shows the product id purchase amount and the date of purchased 

### there is one common variable naming mistake which is not that important i.e. sales final is by mistake named as salary
